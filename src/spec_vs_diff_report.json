  "summary": "Diff implements a new Edit instructions field in Studio state with persistence/backward-compat loading, adds a placeholder async image editor module, and extends flash overlay settings/types/rendering to include color/size/position/animationSpeed; CreativePreview is updated to run the placeholder edit flow and manage edited image output. One potentially unrequested behavior (auto-regenerate on seed change) appears added.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest did not request automatic regeneration behavior tied to seed changes; only requested adding UI controls and wiring them into generation/edit flows.",
